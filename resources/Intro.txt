You have just awaken to a pile of destruction all around you.

Upon further investigation, you are inside of what looks to be a jungle.

You realize that you are no longer in the air, flying your airplane, but you have been ejected from the plane.

Luckily, the parachute saved your life, but you are not sure of all the events that have transpired.

You stand up and look around. You see a backpack and a few items laying next to you.

You grab the backpack and look inside to see a full water bottle and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

You have a choice to pick up items or key items to help you on your journey.

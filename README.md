# Crash Survivor

### **Story:**

###### **Intro:**

You have just awaken to a pile of destruction all around you.

Upon further investigation, you are inside of what looks to be a jungle.

You realize that you are no longer in the air, flying your airplane, but you have been ejected from the plane.

Luckily, the parachute saved your life, but you are not sure of all the events that have transpired.

You stand up and look around. You see a backpack and a few items laying next to you. 

You grab the backpack and look inside to see a full water bottle and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Now, you have a choice to pick up one of the following items to help you on your journey:

Flare, flint, or pocket knife.

###### Encounters:

You have come across a very aggressive (Wildlife). You have no choice but to fight the (Wildlife). 
Choose your next action:

###### **River:**

After exiting the thick brush of the jungle, you see a river that looks to be almost a half mile wide.

On the other side of the river you see what looks to be....PEOPLE!!!

It seems too far away to signal for help. A better option would be to build a boat.

Gather the required supplies to build a boat. Remember, you can only carry so many items.

###### **End of Game:**

You have finally built a quality boat that can take you to the other side of the river.

You paddle as fast as you can and make it to the other side. 

You find some people who understand your language and they help guide you to the Police Station.

You can now breathe a sigh of relief.....you have SURVIVED!!!!
